Available at: PE #76: Dynamic Response of DC-DC Converters under Hysteretic Voltage Control

This video presents the implementation of hysteretic voltage control of dc-dc converters. This is a control method that allows us to regulate the output voltage without having to design and implement a closed-loop compensator. The hysteretic comparator drives the switch directly from the output voltage ripple assuring high accuracy and extremely fast response. The main disadvantage of this control method is the variable operating frequency, which can be an issue in some particular applications. The extremely fast response of this control method is demonstrated by Qspice simulations.
